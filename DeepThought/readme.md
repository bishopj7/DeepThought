The Clack-Attackâ„¢ Deep Thought is an open source 40% keyboard you can download and build on your own!

This keyboard is far from a final design - this is the alpha release of the keyboard. I have been playing around with the key layout and arrangement and am pretty happy with where it is currently. The plate for this particular model supports a 1.5u cap on the caps lock/tab space, though a revision with support for standard 1.75u caps lock position will be released shortly.

Case and plate are designed to be held together with M3 screws, with threading incorporated into the lower case print. There is also a model available with space available to use either knurled nuts or hex nuts heat fitted into position. The MCU retainer is designed for small m2 screws, but self-driving or machine screws should work just fine.

Please feel free to leave any comments for updates or adjustments suggested for the firmware and/or model!
